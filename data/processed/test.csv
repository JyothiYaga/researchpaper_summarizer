2503.15835v1,BARD-GS: Blur-Aware Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes via Gaussian Splatting,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable potential for static scene
reconstruction, and recent advancements have extended its application to
dynamic scenes. However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on
high-quality input images and precise camera poses, which are not that trivial
to fulfill in real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld
monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of
both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion
frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately
handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for
robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and
imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera
motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing
motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them
separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic
regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic
scenes to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BARD-GS
effectively reconstructs high-quality dynamic scenes under realistic
conditions, significantly outperforming existing methods.",['cs.CV'],"['Yiren Lu', 'Yunlai Zhou', 'Disheng Liu', 'Tuo Liang', 'Yu Yin']",2025-03-20,2025-03-20,3D Gaussian Splatting 3DGS has shown remarkable potential for static scene reconstruction and recent advancements have extended its application to dynamic scenes.

2503.16171v1,Guardians of Generation: Dynamic Inference-Time Copyright Shielding with Adaptive Guidance for AI Image Generation,"Modern text-to-image generative models can inadvertently reproduce
copyrighted content memorized in their training data, raising serious concerns
about potential copyright infringement. We introduce Guardians of Generation, a
model agnostic inference time framework for dynamic copyright shielding in AI
image generation. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the
generative model weights, instead integrating seamlessly with existing
diffusion pipelines. It augments the generation process with an adaptive
guidance mechanism comprising three components: a detection module, a prompt
rewriting module, and a guidance adjustment module. The detection module
monitors user prompts and intermediate generation steps to identify features
indicative of copyrighted content before they manifest in the final output. If
such content is detected, the prompt rewriting mechanism dynamically transforms
the user's prompt by sanitizing or replacing references that could trigger
copyrighted material while preserving the prompt's intended semantics. The
adaptive guidance module adaptively steers the diffusion process away from
flagged content by modulating the model's sampling trajectory. Together, these
components form a robust shield that enables a tunable balance between
preserving creative fidelity and ensuring copyright compliance. We validate our
method on a variety of generative models such as Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and
Flux, demonstrating substantial reductions in copyrighted content generation
with negligible impact on output fidelity or alignment with user intent. This
work provides a practical, plug-and-play safeguard for generative image models,

2503.15851v1,Zero-1-to-A: Zero-Shot One Image to Animatable Head Avatars Using Video Diffusion,"Animatable head avatar generation typically requires extensive data for
training. To reduce the data requirements, a natural solution is to leverage
existing data-free static avatar generation methods, such as pre-trained
diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS), which align avatars
with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However, directly
distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results
due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address
this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial
and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video

that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning

steps, but have not directly analyzed the effect of incorrect scene scales on
their application. In this paper, we seek to understand and address the effect
of scale ambiguity when used to train generative novel view synthesis methods
(GNVS). In GNVS, new views of a scene or object can be minimally synthesized
given a single image and are, thus, unconstrained, necessitating the use of
generative methods. The generative nature of these models captures all aspects
of uncertainty, including any uncertainty of scene scales, which act as
nuisance variables for the task. We study the effect of scene scale ambiguity
in GNVS when sampled from a single image by isolating its effect on the
resulting models and, based on these intuitions, define new metrics that
measure the scale inconsistency of generated views. We then propose a framework
to estimate scene scales jointly with the GNVS model in an end-to-end fashion.
Empirically, we show that our method reduces the scale inconsistency of
generated views without the complexity or downsides of previous scale
normalization methods. Further, we show that removing this ambiguity improves

2503.14395v1,Weakly Supervised Spatial Implicit Neural Representation Learning for 3D MRI-Ultrasound Deformable Image Registration in HDR Prostate Brachytherapy,"Purpose: Accurate 3D MRI-ultrasound (US) deformable registration is critical
for real-time guidance in high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy. We
present a weakly supervised spatial implicit neural representation (SINR)
method to address modality differences and pelvic anatomy challenges.
  Methods: The framework uses sparse surface supervision from MRI/US
segmentations instead of dense intensity matching. SINR models deformations as
continuous spatial functions, with patient-specific surface priors guiding a
stationary velocity field for biologically plausible deformations. Validation
included 20 public Prostate-MRI-US-Biopsy cases and 10 institutional HDR cases,
evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD),
and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95).
  Results: The proposed method achieved robust registration. For the public
dataset, prostate DSC was $0.93 \pm 0.05$, MSD $0.87 \pm 0.10$ mm, and HD95
$1.58 \pm 0.37$ mm. For the institutional dataset, prostate CTV achieved DSC
$0.88 \pm 0.09$, MSD $1.21 \pm 0.38$ mm, and HD95 $2.09 \pm 1.48$ mm. Bladder
and rectum performance was lower due to ultrasound's limited field of view.
Visual assessments confirmed accurate alignment with minimal discrepancies.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a novel weakly supervised SINR-based

supervision and spatial priors, it achieves accurate, robust, and
computationally efficient registration, enhancing real-time image guidance in
HDR prostate brachytherapy and improving treatment precision.","['physics.med-ph', 'cs.CV']","['Jing Wang', 'Ruirui Liu', 'Yu Lei', 'Michael J.

datasets. That is, they assess vulnerabilities using security-related code
datasets while validating functionality with general code datasets. In
addition, prior research primarily relies on a single static analyzer, CodeQL,
to detect vulnerabilities in generated code, which limits the scope of security
evaluation.
  In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to systematically assess the

validation to the same generated code and evaluate these two aspects together.

2503.16192v1,Nonparametric Bellman Mappings for Value Iteration in Distributed Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration
(VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where multiple agents operate
over a network without a centralized fusion node. Each agent constructs its own
nonparametric B-Map for VI while communicating only with direct neighbors to
achieve consensus. These B-Maps operate on Q-functions represented in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling a nonparametric formulation that
allows for flexible, agent-specific basis function design. Unlike existing DRL
methods that restrict information exchange to Q-function estimates, the
proposed framework also enables agents to share basis information in the form
of covariance matrices, capturing additional structural details. A theoretical
analysis establishes linear convergence rates for both Q-function and
covariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values. The optimal learning
rates for consensus-based updates are dictated by the ratio of the smallest
positive eigenvalue to the largest one of the network's Laplacian matrix.
Furthermore, each nodal Q-function estimate is shown to lie very close to the
fixed point of a centralized nonparametric B-Map, effectively allowing the
proposed DRL design to approximate the performance of a centralized fusion
center. Numerical experiments on two well-known control problems demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps compared to prior
methods. Notably, the results reveal a counter-intuitive finding: although the
proposed approach involves greater information exchange -- specifically through
the sharing of covariance matrices -- it achieves the desired performance with

these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods
remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction.
At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses
3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It
then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details,
capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in
microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance
efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression
strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a
masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token
positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these
strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single
autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D

adapting sequential prediction techniques from language modeling. However,
applying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data

However, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the

assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of
two stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse
labels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that
simultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their

2503.14698v1,SplatVoxel: History-Aware Novel View Streaming without Temporal Training,"We study the problem of novel view streaming from sparse-view videos, which
aims to generate a continuous sequence of high-quality, temporally consistent
novel views as new input frames arrive. However, existing novel view synthesis
methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to
flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce
history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and
improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward
scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate
information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion.
Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that
extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer
integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our
method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are
currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to
sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming

extraction. Moreover, existing detection methods have limitations in adequately
integrating global and local information, which constrains the efficiency and
accuracy of infrared small target detection. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel network architecture named MSCA-Net, which integrates
three key components: Multi-Scale Enhanced Detection Attention

different scales, enriching feature representation. PCBAM captures the

hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and
controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their
relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel

efficient image generation framework, able to deliver high-quality visuals with
low inference costs. However, MaskGIT's token unmasking scheduler, an essential
component of the framework, has not received the attention it deserves. We
analyze the sampling objective in MaskGIT, based on the mutual information
between tokens, and elucidate its shortcomings. We then propose a new sampling
strategy based on our Halton scheduler instead of the original Confidence
scheduler. More precisely, our method selects the token's position according to
a quasi-random, low-discrepancy Halton sequence. Intuitively, that method
spreads the tokens spatially, progressively covering the image uniformly at
each step. Our analysis shows that it allows reducing non-recoverable sampling
errors, leading to simpler hyper-parameters tuning and better quality images.
Our scheduler does not require retraining or noise injection and may serve as a
simple drop-in replacement for the original sampling strategy. Evaluation of

Moreover GraspCoT presents a unified multimodal LLM architecture which encodes multi view observations of 3D scenes into 3D aware visual tokens and then jointly embeds these visual tokens with CoT derived textual tokens within LLMs to generate grasp pose predictions. Furthermore we present IntentGrasp a large scale benchmark that fills the gap in public datasets for multi object grasp detection under diverse and indirect verbal commands. Extensive experiments on IntentGrasp demonstrate the superiority of our method with additional validation in real world robotic applications confirming its practicality.

Margin SVM, which penalizes the magnitude of constraint violations, the
proposed model quantifies the number of violations and aims to minimize their

objective function of the primal SVM formulation, replacing the traditional
slack variable. Furthermore, each misclassified sample is assigned a priority
and an associated constraint. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer
programming model, efficiently solved using Benders decomposition. The proposed
model's performance was benchmarked against existing models, including Soft
Margin SVM, weighted SVM, and NuSVC. Two primary hypotheses were examined: 1)
The proposed model improves the F1-score for the minority class in imbalanced
classification tasks. 2) The proposed model enhances classification accuracy in
noisy datasets. These hypotheses were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test across
multiple publicly available datasets from the OpenML repository. The results
supported both hypotheses (\( p < 0.05 \)). In addition, the proposed model

2503.15706v1,Using machine learning to map simulated noisy and laser-limited multidimensional spectra to molecular electronic couplings,"Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has enabled significant

Although deriving chemical information from 2DES is a complex task, machine
learning (ML) offers exciting opportunities to translate complicated
spectroscopic data into physical insight. Recent studies have found that neural
networks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale
properties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture
experimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and
suboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental
utility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated
with experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map
simulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By
systematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000
simulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for
spectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 6.6 if background
noise dominates vs. > 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to
human-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves
significantly (ca. 84% $\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the
bandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent
with the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of
molecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting
simulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently
imperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned

counterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.","['physics.chem-ph', 'cs.LG', 'quant-ph']","['Jonathan D. Schultz', 'Kelsey A. Parker', 'Bashir Sbaiti', 'David N.

2503.17211v1,A Language Anchor-Guided Method for Robust Noisy Domain Generalization,"Real-world machine learning applications often struggle with two major
challenges: distribution shift and label noise. Models tend to overfit by
focusing on redundant and uninformative features in the training data, which
makes it hard for them to generalize to the target domain. Noisy data worsens
this problem by causing further overfitting to the noise, meaning that existing
methods often fail to tell the difference between true, invariant features and
misleading, spurious ones. To tackle these issues, we introduce Anchor
Alignment and Adaptive Weighting (A3W). This new algorithm uses sample
reweighting guided by natural language processing (NLP) anchors to extract more
representative features. In simple terms, A3W leverages semantic
representations from natural language models as a source of domain-invariant
prior knowledge. Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts
each sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP
anchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels. Extensive

robustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly
strong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS --

2503.14345v2,MoonCast: High-Quality Zero-Shot Podcast Generation,"Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in
generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However,
these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long,
multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such
as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long
speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of
most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous,
oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing
works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose
MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to
synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories,
technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of
unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language
model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech
data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to
generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to
be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate
that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in
spontaneity and coherence.","['eess.AS', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SD']","['Zeqian Ju', 'Dongchao Yang', 'Jianwei Yu', 'Kai Shen', 'Yichong Leng', 'Zhengtao Wang', 'Xu Tan', 'Xinyu Zhou', 'Tao Qin', 'Xiangyang Li']",2025-03-18,2025-03-19,Recent advances in text to speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high quality short utterances for individual speakers.

semantic detection boxes (SemDBs). Innovatively transmitting these
information-rich object-level sparse features among agents not only
significantly reduces the demanding communication volume, but also improves 3D
object detection performance. Specifically, a fully sparse network is
constructed to extract SemDBs from individual agents; a temporal fusion
approach with a relative temporal encoding mechanism is utilized to obtain the
comprehensive spatiotemporal features. Extensive experiments on the V2XSet and
OPV2V datasets demonstrate that Which2comm consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods on both perception performance and communication cost,
exhibiting better robustness to real-world latency. These results present that
for multi-agent collaborative 3D object detection, transmitting only
object-level sparse features is sufficient to achieve high-precision and robust
performance.",['cs.CV'],"['Duanrui Yu', 'Jing You', 'Xin Pei', 'Anqi Qu', 'Dingyu Wang', 'Shaocheng Jia']",2025-03-21,2025-03-21,Collaborative perception allows real time inter agent information exchange and thus offers invaluable opportunities to enhance the perception capabilities of individual agents. However limited communication bandwidth in practical scenarios restricts the inter agent data transmission volume consequently resulting in performance declines in collaborative perception systems. This implies a trade off between perception performance and communication cost. To address this issue we propose Which2comm a novel multi agent 3D object detection framework leveraging object level sparse features.

2503.14905v1,Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection with Artifact Explanation,"With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in
everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection.
Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity
and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and
do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed
for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only
excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural
language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability.
Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over
100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact
clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to
expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it
a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across
multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity
classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for
synthetic image detection. The dataset and code will be released in:
